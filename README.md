## 🏄‍♂️ Sports & Adventure

Coding fuels my mind, but sports fuel my soul. I can’t imagine life without movement and challenge!  
- 🌊 **Wakeboarding Enthusiast:** Catching air and carving waves is my ultimate playground.  
- 🏃‍♂️ **Marathon Runner:** Pounding the pavement for 42.195 km keeps me disciplined and focused.  
- 🏔️ **High-Altitude Climber:** Conquering 4,000 m peaks is just the beginning—my dream is to stand atop an 8,000 m giant one day.

## 🌍 Traveler & Lifelong Learner

I have an insatiable curiosity for the world and its cultures. Every journey teaches me something new—about geography, about people, and about myself.  
- ✈️ Explored let explored = ["🇨🇭","🇳🇴","🇫🇷","🇩🇪","🇵🇱","🇨🇿","🇦🇹","🇭🇷","🇵🇹","🇸🇪","🇸🇮","🇬🇷","🏝️","🇲🇾","🇹🇭"] countries and counting…  
- 📚 Always reading, watching tutorials, and experimenting with new ideas.

## 🧠 My Philosophy

> “I am a learner, not a seeker.”  

This simple mantra keeps me grounded, always open to growth, and forever hungry for knowledge. Whether it’s a new algorithm, a mountaineering technique, or a cultural insight, I’m here to learn, improve, and share.
